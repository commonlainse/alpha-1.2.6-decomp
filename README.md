# alpha-1.2.6-decomp
A decompilation of Alpha 1.2.6 client done with Vineflower, CFR, reading bytecode and guessing.
The list of modifications is as follows:
- Few patches to make it build
- Deobfuscated most of the source code
- JCraft's JOgg and JOrbis are included in the source code. Probably breaking a license in the process :P

## Isn't this againsn't TOS?
Yes

## Why not MCP (Minecraft Coder Pack)?
Initially to have fun, then I realized this isn't fun, then I was too far into the sunk cost fallacy.

## Building
If you're using NetBeans and know a little Java it should be fairly straightforward.
I'll write an absolute beginner guide later.
